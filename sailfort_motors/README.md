## Sailfort Motors project : Prroviding data-driven suggestion for HR
### Project Overview
Sailfort Motors is currently experiencing high employee turnover. To address this, the company has asked the data team with building a machine learning model to predict which employees might leave the company based on various factors. The ultimate goal is to find solutions that can increase employee retention. The model is based on data collected through a survey conducted by the Human Resources department.  
### Business Understanding
For this project, the stakeholders include the data team and the Human Resources team. Our goal is to build a regression model to understand why employees leave the company and to help improve employee retention rates. Most of the columns are numerical and pertain to the employee environment within the company. An important ethical consideration is that part of the data is derived from surveys, which may not be fully completed by all employees.

### Data Understanding

First, we start with data exploration and cleaning.  
After obtaining the basic information, renaming the columns, and checking missing values, duplicates and outliers, we found no missing values and 824 outliers in the time_at_company column. We identified and removed 3008 duplicates.

During data exploration, we determined that attrition represents 16.6% of the data, while those who stay represent 83.3%.  
Following this, we started to visualize the data to better understand and analyze it. (All the visualizations are available in the images files.)

![Average_monthly_hour_by_salary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76ffc00a-866d-459d-8a97-91ed75e08dad)
We have learned that the number of projects, the average monthly hour and tenure are correlated, it's could indicating potential management issues. Employee with high salary leave less the company than the others. The highest number of resignations occur between 3 and 5 years at the company. Additionally, after six years, employees seem to stay in their job. Employee attrition is negatively corrolated with their satisfaction level, but it is corrolated with tenure. We could conclude that it may not be rewarding work lot of hour without high evaluation score or promotion.  
### Modeling and Evaluation
For the modeling, we need to predict a binary outcome, so we start by logistic regression and then we tried a random forest to improve performance. After checking the assumptions, we encoded the data and removed the outliers. We then sampled the data and constructed the logistic model. However, the model did not perform well, only slightly better than a random classifier. The precision score is 0.44 indicating that the model missies more possitive value (left) than it correctly identifies. The F1 score is also very poor. Therefore, we need to construct another predictive model.  
We switched to a tree-based model and observed that the decision tree model outperforms the logistic regression model. The F1 score is very good with 0.942, and the other metrics are also high. The accuracy score indicates that the model correctly predicts 98% of the left value. Additionaly, the results with the test set are better.   
We then switch to random forest model to see if it could deliver better predictability. The F1 score of the random forest is slightly better than that of the decision tree model, achieving an impressive F1 score of 0.955 on the test set. Additionally, the precision socre is 2% higher than the second-best model, indicating high accuracy in predicting attrition. With the random forest model, we identified the most important features in predicting attrition: satisfaction level, number of project, tenure and average monthly hour. This random forest model balances the importance of each factor better than the simple decision tree, resulting in a smaller emphasis on satisfaction level, while other features appear more significant.  
### Conclusion
To conclude, the models and feature importance extracted from the analysis confirm that one of the company's attrition problems is employees being overworked. Following this, we will create an executive summary to communicate the study's conclusions, recommendations, and necessary next steps to stakeholders. Additionally, we will develop a dashboard to help stakeholders visualize and better understand the information.
